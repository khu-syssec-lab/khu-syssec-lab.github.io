(Co-advised by Prof. Daehee Jang, Pwn Lab @ KHU)

I am a M.S. Candidate in Computer Engineering, specializing in Convergence Security at KyungHee University. I joined the KHU-SysSec Lab lead by Prof. CheolJun Park as a Student Researcher in December 2024.
My Masters research focuses on Space/Satellite Security with a particular interest in Satellite communications and Satellite internet.
